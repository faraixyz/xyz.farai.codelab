description: The tools used to make this very website.

This site was made possible with the following tools.

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is the static site generator I used to build this website. I like it because it's fast, feature rich ~~and I have Stockholm Syndrome since it can be frustrating to use at times and I'm too scared to try something different~~.
* [Modern Font Stacks](https://modernfontstacks.com#monospace-code) is where I got the monospace typeface you see here. It's a bold choice but I like how it looks. I do hope to switch to the [Recursive Design font](https:/recursive.design/) once I've sorted out the subsetting.
* [Github](https://github.com/faraixyz/xyz.farai.codelab) is where I host the source code of this website as well as build the site with GitHub Actions to host on Cloudflare Pages.
* [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) is where I host my website.
