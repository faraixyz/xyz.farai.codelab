## On [Farai's Codelab Returns](/content/notes/farais-codelab-returns.md) {#codelab-returns}

These posts are yet to be put online so I couldn't link to them yet though I should:

* Link to all the previous versions of this personal website
* ~~link to post on 5 year coding review~~
* link my posts on the many drafts I have
* link to job search fail
* link to web page on worrystones which highlights my site recreation anxiety

## On [Slight Loss](/content/notes/slight-loss.md)

* Show an example of the difference lossy compression makes (present but irrelevant)
* Walk through making an XKCD or digital illustration smaller.
