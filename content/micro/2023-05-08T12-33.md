![VS Code's source control panel with files ready to stage where the first file has a greyed out stage and discard button.](/images/b23b16c95742da9fd01ac8420958b339bb09b989.png)For some reason, I can’t stage files in VS Code. It’s such a random error that just popped up.

~~Looks like I’m not the only one with [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/181154).~~

It's fixed now.
