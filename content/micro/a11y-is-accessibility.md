Here Eric justifies the use of the [numeronym](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym) a11y for accessibility (the 11 being the number of characters between the a and y). Numeronyms are nothing new (i18l, w3c) and it helps people find communities ([#11y on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/tags/a11y)) and resources (like Eric's [A11y Project](https://www.a11yproject.com/)) for developers working on accessibility.

Along with this he goes over what accessibility should be about (adressing an ablist world), and what allies should do (listnen to disabled folks and not demanding them to adress your (probably already asked) questions) and some issues with the term a11y (which either aren't issues or are a feature rather than a bug).

I use the tag a11y for accessibility content since it's much easier to write.
