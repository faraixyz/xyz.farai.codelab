Web sustainability has been on my mind recently and I randomly thought of an [numeronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym) for it since those are [common in tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym#Numerical_contractions:~:text=Examples%20of%20numerical%20contractions,in%20Iceland).

Much like how a11y is for web accessibility and in8l is for web internationalization, s12y (pronounced stwelvy) makes sense for web sustainability.

Unlike a11y, I doubt I'll get reply guys saying s12y isn't sustainable, but I'm using it for similar [reasons as to why a11y is used](/micro/a11y-is-accessibility.md)â€”it's a convenient tag for web developers that stands out from sustainability in general.

I plan to write a bunch of [s12y content](/content/tags/s12y/_index.md) so stay tuned for that.

As for who else does this:

* [Some minutes on forming a working group on s12y](https://www.w3.org/2021/10/19-sustainability-minutes.html)
* [The S12Y Wiki](https://s12y.wiki/)
* [Some event in Barcelona that's coming in a week's time](https://sdialliance.org/s12y-workshop-barcelona/2024/)

That's pretty much it so far. I hope this catches on.
