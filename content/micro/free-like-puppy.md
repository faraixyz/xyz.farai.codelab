There's the concept of ["free as in puppy"](https://blog.mahabali.me/whyopen/openlearning17/free-as-in-puppies-and-other-metaphors-openlearning17/)[^1] which boils down to how open source isn't necessarily cheap to maintain contributed code since much like a puppy, you need to take care of it[^2].

Here Nicholas illustrates the concept with a personal example

[^1]: An offshoot of ["free as in speech" and "free as in beer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre)
[^2]: This past year my dogs had so many health issues which couldn't necessarily be solved by donating them.
