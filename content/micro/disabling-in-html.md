Here Kitty illustrates the difference between `disabled` (which makes a form control or button unusable) and `aria-disabled` (which merely communicates that an element is disabled but does not *actually* disable it). Not that you should disable buttons since [itâ€™s quite confusing](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/08/frustrating-design-patterns-disabled-buttons/).

I'm just thinking of this tweet I read once which was like:

> Think of WAI-ARIA like Ariana Grande. Much like how Ariana Grande tries to look Asian, Black and so on without actually being those, ARIA makes an element look like something whilst it actually isn't.

Evidently this was years ago as [Ariana has resolved to be ~~Italian~~ white](https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/celebrity-photos/ariana-grande-has-shaken-up-her-look-and-fans-are-shocked-at-how-different-she-looks/news-story/18413cd0a479a56d0e7459f42b751c1c).
