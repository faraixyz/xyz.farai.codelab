*Oops, I forgot to add sass to the build so I didn't actually deploy the site 😜🤦🏾‍♂️, hope you can see it now.*

I nearly forgot about this today. I hope you like my sexy naked `<body>`.

Looks the same as [last time](/content/micro/naked-css-2023.md), but I used Firefox this time which uses a lighter blue for the links. It's also interesting to see all the places I used an `sr-only` class which I had to do for links.

![A bunch of hyperlinked text in Times New Roman, this time the links are a lighter blue.](/images/naked-site-2024.png)
