I literally wanted to do this a year ago when [DigitalOcean's purchase of CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/css-tricks-is-joining-digitalocean/) was announced but I didn't get around to it for some reason. Had another chance last month when I heard that [DigitalOcean had laid off the editor Geoff](https://geoffgraham.me/goodbye-css-tricks/).

The only reason I'm getting around to it now is that I'm moving in some old content and noticed [the two posts I wrote for CSS Tricks](/content/elsewhere/_index.md). This was the first earned income I've gotten since graduating university so I'll always be greatful to [Chris](https://chriscoyier.net/), [Robin](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/an-ode-to-css-tricks/) and [Geoff](https://chriscoyier.net/2022/05/12/why-did-you-originally-build-css-tricks/) of the CSS Tricks team for giving me a chance. I had tried two times before and got rejected and I'm glad they put up with me even though I took forever.

Asides from letting me contribute to the site, I'll always be thankful for their tricks (hehe), like their super handy [Flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). I thank all the writers for all the great work they've done and wish them all the best in their future work!
