One reason I've struggled to write is that I don't know how to categorize information. Doing so would not only makes it easy for me to organize, it will help readers navigate this site. Organizing the site factors in:

* what sections should this site have
* what metadata to include with each post
* how to evolve the structure as I understand organization better

and so on.

There's two particular places where this is a big issue, media and links.

As a way to write more, I write notes on links from around the web. Should they be in a separate section? How do I attribute a link source, particularly on a user generated content site like YouTube? What if multiple links cover a particular topic? Do I make them as a note or classify a particular note as a winner? Is there any point in having a link section at all as every post can technically handle links?

I also want to write about [media I've consumed](https://im.farai.xyz/tags/media-reviews/). Fair enough but what metadata should they have? How to handle multiple authors and cases where a particular piece of media is at a URL and available physically? If I watch or read an entire series, how do I comment on all of themâ€“in pieces or as a whole? On the other hand, what if I have nothing to say about it? I just enjoyed it for its own sake and I'd like to suggest it to my (non-existent) readers, but a blank post is wasteful? <span id="up1"></span>Some media (like [<cite>Spud</cite>](https://im.farai.xyz/blog/spud/)) are in multiple mediums[^1], should they be separate or combined?

This just scratches the surface. There are other things like whether I should separate my tech content or shove in all in one place. Biggest of all is how to structure it in a way that makes Hugo happy with its complex [content management system](https://gohugo.io/content-management/)[^2]?

I don't even know where to start at getting better at this. People get degrees in this shit. They're called librarians, which I'm not (though [I worked for some](/content/notes/job-in-college.md)).

This [resource from NNGroup](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ia-study-guide/) seems useful and I'll go through it once I have time. For now, [I'll just write shit](https://im.farai.xyz/blog/fine-ill-write/) and send set up a redirect once I figure this out since [cool URLs last forever](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI). My site is a digital garden, I should lean into it.

[^1]: Funny how I'm using mediums as plural and media as singular here.
[^2]: Using another blogging platform isn't an option since I'm sick of remaking my site over and over again. I wanna focus on other programming projects.
