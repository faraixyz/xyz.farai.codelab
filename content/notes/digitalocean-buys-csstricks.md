> CSS-Tricks deserves more human muscle behind it than I’ve been able to provide for it. That’s where DigitalOcean comes in. That’s the “why now.” They have the resources to put behind CSS-Tricks, and the motivation to do so. I fully trust them to do it, as they’ve been successfully doing it themselves for a long time.

I was wondering why CSS-Tricks weren't posting much in the past few weeks and it turns out it's because they got acquired by Digital Ocean.

To that I say congrats to the CSS-Tricks team and I wish them all the best. While they're an infrastructure platform, Digital Ocean have amazing technical writing so I'm sure they'll take good care of CSS Tricks.

I'd also like to thank them on two fronts. Firstly, I'd like to thank them for all the amazing content they put out, especially their [Flexbox guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/). Secondly, I'd like to thank them for taking a chance on me and [publishing my work](https://css-tricks.com/author/faraigandiyafarai/). They've polished my work and they've been patient as I've taken far longer than I should have to write them. I also appreciate the money since it's the first time since graduating that I've been paid for work. I still have another piece I plan to write for them so stay tuned for that.

From [An Ode to CSS-Tricks by Robin Rendle](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/an-ode-to-css-tricks/):

> I’ve already said goodbye in this week’s newsletter, but I think it’s the right time to celebrate CSS-Tricks and everything that Chris has done for the web community over the years. Because I can’t think of another website that I’ve grown up with that’s continued to be such an important part of my life.

I wish Chris and the team the best in their future endeavors!
