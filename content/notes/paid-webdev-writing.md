One piece of advice that I wanna act on is to **appeal to gatekeepers**. I got this from [Cal Newport’s](https://calnewport.com) podcast [**Deep Questions**](https://www.calnewport.com/podcast/) where he answers a lot of productivity focused questions. The thinking is that a good way to see if what you’re doing is valuable is to get through gatekeepers (like editors, conference organizers and so on) rather than just do what’s easy (post on social media, write in isolation and what not).

One way I want to do that is by getting something published in a web dev publication. I’ve found some who are open for guest posts and also pay.

I’ve already tried once, but I got turned down. I planned on keeping this list up to date, but I found [a GitHub page with a collection of publications](https://github.com/malgamves/CommunityWriterPrograms) and the site [Who Pays Technical Writers](https://whopaystechnicalwriters.com/).
