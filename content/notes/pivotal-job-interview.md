Thanks to a random stranger on the internet, I got to interview at Pivotal in San Francisco. Here's how it went.

## First Interview

The first interview had paired up with one of their engineers to implement a [set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(abstract_data_type)).

I was aware of this thanks to Glassdoor so I spent a week looking into how to implement a Set. I figured that I'd need to implement an AVL tree as the underlining structure of a Set[^1]. I couldn't figure out tree rotations so I stuck with the naive approach of array manipulation.

Thankfully it went better than I had expected. Since they use TDD, the interview was slow paced. Failing test, laziest change, actual implementation, refactor, repeat for an hour. A few days later, the recruiter got back and I was on to the next round.

## Remote Pairing
Since a location wasn't specified on my application, I told them that I was okay with either San Francisco or New York. Instead of sending me on-site right away, they decided that it would be best to pair with one of their New York-based engineers to decide on whether to move on site or not. They were nice enough to send me some prep materials which were centered around Go. Once I got to the interview, I paired with one of their engineers to fix a bug on one of their Java Spring applications.

As a Python and JavaScript guy, I was taken aback a little. My only exposure to Java was an elective class I took where I made some crappy memory game and a few failed attempts at learning Android Development. Even though my Java was shaky, I was able to work with the engineer to fix the bug. Over the 4 hours, I got to ask a few questions about the companies culture as well as what itâ€™s like working in New York.

After the interview, the engineer wrote some feedback which was good enough for me to move on sight. I talked with the interviewer about my experience, salary expectations[^2] and travel logistics.

## First Time in San Francisco

Just after graduation, I went to LA and Vegas with my family. I wanted LA and San Francisco but my sister insisted on Vegas and LA instead so I was excited that I got to go to San Francisco. The day before the interview, I got into San Francisco around 2 pm before I took the train to the hotel, which was conveniently placed across the road from Pivotalâ€™s San Francisco offices[^3].

Since I came in early, I decided to watch the <cite>BlacKkKlansman</cite> which was an okay movie. Near the theatre was a mall I decided to check out. I heard that there was a robot barista by [Cafe X](https://www.cafexapp.com/) so I headed to get a Matcha Mocha served by a robot. While the Matcha Mocha had an interesting taste to it and at $3 there arenâ€™t many complaints you could levy towards it, the robot is basically a gimmick. I was planning to go to the [Museum of Ice Cream](https://www.museumoficecream.com/), but it cost $35 for what amounts to an [â€˜Instagram Trapâ€™ [Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qx_r-dP22Ps) so I headed for dinner. 

For dinner, I decided to eat at a [one of those Korean BBQ places [VIDEO]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GTXP2FzQS94). It took hours to find a place I could eat at since most Korean BBQ places have 2 person minimums, but I eventually found [Carbon Grill](http://www.carbongrillsf.com/). On the Lyft there, I got to chat with someone who used to work in tech before he got carpal tunnel. I was going to have dinner with him to chat more, but he decided to eat elsewhere. As for the food, while I struggled to cook and eat with chopsticks[^4], it tasted really good. I then headed back to get some good rest before the interviews the next day.

## The Onsite Interviews

The next day, I checked out of the hotel and headed to Pivotalâ€™s office right across the road. After meeting my host, I was invited for breakfast which they serve for their workers every day. I sat with the host and was joined with another person[^5] being interviewed along with my first interviewer. After breakfast, I headed down for one of their sprint meetings before my interview began.

For the first pairing interview, I worked on one of their APIs built with Ruby and Sinatra. Asides from a footnote in my internet programming class, Iâ€™ve never touched Ruby. It took a while to figure out what was going on but I got the hang of it, sort of. I think the task was barely completed by lunchtime where we modified a higher level test to figure out what was going on.

The office serves lunch to their workers once a week accompanied by a discussion. Apparently, theyâ€™ve hosted a chair startup before. Anyways, after lunch, I headed to the next pairing task. This time around, there was a very low-level system bug that needed fixing. The system was implemented in Go which I had an even dimmer idea of in spite of my attempt to learn it. While I did figure out what was going on thanks to what I learned in my computer networking class, I still had a lot of WTF moments.

After the interview, I said my goodbyes before wandering around SF until my midnight flight back to Michigan. In the time wandering SF, I had fried chicken and Mac for dinner and some actual waffles, with ice cream[^6]! I then headed back to Michigan eagerly awaiting a response.

## Response and Conclusion

Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t get the job. After crying over it for a bit, I decided to apply for more jobs in hopes that something would come up (spoiler nothing did). Still, I think this was a good interview process. Even though I didnâ€™t have a lot of experience with the programming languages used in the interviews, I was able to figure things out. While I donâ€™t have a problem with pairing, it seems like you need to be a certain type of person to do it 8 hours a day. I like the experience of what their work days are actually like so I can experience the culture. The only improvement I could think of is getting paid since it was basically doing work (although the problems have already been solved). Then again, theyâ€™ve probably spent thousands of dollars interviewing me at that point.

Looking back on it, I kinda realize why I didnâ€™t do so well. Remember the WTF moments I mentioned in the Go interview? I really wish I had a more systematic approach to addressing ambiguity rather than asking "what the fuck is going on" over and over. Not sure how to fix this but I think this might be the key to doing better at interviews.

[^1]: This isn't quite right. A better way to do this to work off of a hashmap, implemented with open addressing of an array with an AVL tree to handle collisions.
[^2]: Donâ€™t say a number first. Try to get a range and decide if itâ€™s acceptable. In California, they have to. I didnâ€™t realize it and I thought they were being nice when I was being coy about giving salary expectations.
[^3]: Much closer than the Goldman Sachs interview across the river in another state.
[^4]: If youâ€™re bad at using chopsticks you can either learn how to use them properly, get the kids chopsticks with a rubber band at the end or just humble yourself and ask for a fork. No big deal (in the US at least).
[^5]: The person worked at Google for 4 years before getting fed up with it. They mentioned how Wi-Fi connected buses are a ruse to make people work longer. Interestingly, I got another perspective at my Google Interviews. Stay tuned to learn what this perspective is In another post.
[^6]: One strange thing about the US is that they donâ€™t do waffles properly. Iâ€™m used to them being a dessert item with ice cream rather than a breakfast item. Even worse, they even have [waffles with fried chicken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken_and_waffles)ðŸ˜±. Not sure who decided to put them together.
